# Ontoclass
The Ontological Classifier (OntoClass for short) is a software designed to help reduce the subjective factor inherent to records classification. It uses OWL ontologies to link easy to remember characteristics of the documents (e.g. "image", "photograph", "news", "interview" etc.) to its actual class in the classification scheme.

All informations about the software are explained in the article in the Extras folder.
