# Ontoclass
The Ontological Classifier (OntoClass for short) is a software designed to help reduce the subjective factor inherent to records classification. It uses OWL ontologies to link easy to remember characteristics of the documents (e.g. "image", "photograph", "news", "interview" etc.) to its actual class in the classification scheme.

By now, it's just a prototype, so in order to use it, you need to have Python and the modules Tkinter and rdfLib installed.

## How to test
In the Extras folder, there are two files: one is the published article about the OntoClass, that you can read for more details of the project; the other is an ontology that can be used to test the software.

All informations about the software are explained in the article in the Extras folder.
